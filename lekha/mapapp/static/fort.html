        Sajra Fort is a historic hilltop fort, built by Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj in 1678 on Mama Malai hill near Vellore Fort. Its strategic purpose was to facilitate the bombardment of the lower Vellore Fort during a 14-month siege, which ultimately led to Maratha control of the region for the next 30 years. The fort is entirely made of rock, but it is now in a state of disrepair, with crumbling structures and heavy vegetation.
